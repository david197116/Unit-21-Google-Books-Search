# Project Google-Books-Search

I can honestly said that this was a hard project for me. I used code already on github to merge to my project. 

I used the Google Books API and Mongoese DB as well as other dependencies to get it to work to a certain point.

Authentication still a working project. My goal is to be able to start and complete a full fuctional Application on my own with minimal use of others work.
